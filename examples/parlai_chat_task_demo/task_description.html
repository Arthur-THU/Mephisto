<h1>Movie Recommendation in Conversations</h1>
<br />
<h3>What is this task?</h3>
<p>
  In this task, you will be assigned a role, either a movie <b>seeker</b> or a movie <b>recommender</b>. The seeker
  will ask the recommender for recommendation, and the recommender should recommend at least 3 movies that the seeker
  accepts.
</p>
<br /><br />
<h3>Critical Information!</h3>
<p>
  The seeker will be given characteristic about preferences of movies. <b>However, both the seeker and the recommender
    can't directly talk about the preferences, or the HIT will be rejected.</b> The recommender should <em>guess</em>
  the preferences in the following way:
<ol>
  <li>The recommender directly recommends a movie (e.g., I think you can't miss $Avatar$!)</li>
  <li>The seeker asks about the information about the movie (e.g., What does the movie talk about?)</li>
  <li>The recommender talks about the movie (e.g., It tells that people on earth want to plunder resources on other
    planets and the aliens fight back.)</li>
  <li>The seeker accepts or rejects the recommendation based on the preferences (e.g., Can you recommend something else
    rather than science
    fiction movie?)</li>
</ol>
