# Video segmentation demo
This example script demonstrates being able to display videos and split them into segments at annotated time stamps.

After adding videos to the `videos` directory, this specific example can be run with:
```console
python run_task.py
```

You can also specify your own videos directory with:
```console
python run_task.py video_source_dir=path/to/dir
```
