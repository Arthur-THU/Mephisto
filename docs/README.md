# Mephisto Docs

- Looking to get set-up and running quickly with Mephisto? Check out the **[10 minute quickstart](quickstart.md)**.

- Want to learn more about the different concepts within Mephisto and how they work together? The excellent and thorough **[architecture overview](architecture_overview.md)** should serve as a great deep-dive and reference for beginners and advanced users alike.

### Customization

- Are you interested in building a custom frontend? Learn about how you can create a **[simple React task](../examples/static_react_task/)**. Reference the docs for the **[`mephisto-task` helper package](../packages/mephisto-task/README.md)**.

- Are you interested in dialogue-based tasks using the ParlAI framework? You may want to check out the **[example ParlAI demo task](../examples/parlai_chat_task_demo/)**. For UI customizations, we heavily use the **[`bootstrap-chat` helper package](../packages/bootstrap-chat/)**, so you may want to reference the documentation for that as well.
